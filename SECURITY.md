## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- Keep your API keys secure and never commit them to version control
- Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts
- Enable two-factor authentication where available
- Regularly update your dependencies
- Monitor your account activity
- Use HTTPS in production environments

### For Developers
- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement rate limiting and request validation
- Log security-relevant events
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
